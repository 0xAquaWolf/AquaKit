## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js 15 application with App Router that integrates Convex for backend services and Better Auth for authentication.

### Key Architecture Components

**Authentication Stack:**
- Better Auth with Convex integration (`@convex-dev/better-auth`)
- Auth client configured in `src/lib/auth-client.ts`
- Authentication routes in `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`
- Convex auth configuration in `convex/auth.config.ts`

**Convex Integration:**
- Convex backend with Better Auth plugin in `convex/convex.config.ts`
- Client provider wraps the app in `src/app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx`
- Schema definitions in `convex/schema.ts`
- HTTP endpoints in `convex/http.ts`

**Frontend Structure:**
- Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom configuration
- UI components in `src/components/ui/`
- Path aliases: `@/*` for `src/*` and `@/convex/*` for `convex/*`

### Environment Setup

The application requires:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Convex deployment URL
- `CONVEX_SITE_URL` - Used in auth configuration

### Styling and UI

- Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS configuration
- Custom component system using `class-variance-authority`
- Lucide React for icons
- Geist font family (Sans and Mono variants)

### State Management

- Zustand for client-side state management
- Convex for server state and real-time data

### Development Notes

- Uses Turbopack for faster builds and development
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Source maps enabled for debugging
- Prettier with import sorting and Tailwind class sorting plugins
