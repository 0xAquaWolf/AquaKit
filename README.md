node scripts/setup-admin.js

# Or follow the quick guide
# See: QUICK_ADMIN_SETUP.md
```

#### OAuth Configuration

After following the setup guides, configure your environment variables:

```bash
# Local environment (.env.local)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="your-github-client-id"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="your-github-client-secret"

# Convex environment
npx convex env set GITHUB_CLIENT_ID "your-github-client-id"
npx convex env set GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET "your-github-client-secret"
```

#### MCP Server Setup

AquaKit includes MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration for enhanced AI development. Configure your editor to use the Convex MCP server:

**Cursor Configuration:**

Add to your `cline_mcp_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "convex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "convex@latest", "mcp", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code Configuration:**

Add the MCP server and test with:

```bash
# Add the server
claude mcp add-json convex '{"type":"stdio","command":"npx","args":["convex","mcp","start"]}'

# Test the connection
claude mcp get convex
```

- Path aliases: `@/*` for `src/*` and `@/convex/*` for `convex/*`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

AquaKit dramatically reduces development time by providing a complete, pre-integrated stack. Instead of spending weeks configuring tools and services, you can:

- **Ship in days, not months**: Skip the tedious setup and focus on your unique AI features
- **Build with AI assistance**: Claude Code + Cursor provide intelligent code completion and generation
- **Scale effortlessly**: Real-time backend with Convex including background jobs with crons and durable functions
- **Monetize immediately**: Built-in payment and subscription system with Polar.sh
- **Learn the modern stack**: Perfect reference implementation of today's best developer tools

**Perfect for:**

- AI startups wanting to move fast
- Developers building AI-powered SaaS products
- Teams looking to modernize their development stack
- Anyone who wants to ship AI products faster

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

> **üéØ Project Mission: Complete Data Ownership**  
> AquaKit's ultimate goal is to give you **complete ownership of your data**. We believe you should control your infrastructure and data, not be locked into proprietary cloud services. That's why we're building two versions to meet different needs while maintaining the same core principle.

### üåü Two Deployment Options

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Version** (Current)

The current implementation uses managed cloud services for rapid development and deployment:

- **Convex** for real-time backend, database, and background processing (crons, durable functions)
- **Better Auth** (package-based, not a service like Clerk)
- **Polar.sh** for payments and subscriptions

_Perfect for: Getting to market quickly, prototyping, teams that prefer managed services_

#### üê≥ **Dockerized Version** (Coming Soon)

A completely self-hostable version for maximum data ownership:

- **One-click Docker deployment** to any server (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Fly.io, etc.)
- **Containerized Convex** - self-hosted to own all your data while keeping the same functionality
- **Better Auth**
- **Self-hosted payment processing**

_Perfect for: Complete data control, enterprise deployments, privacy-focused organizations_
